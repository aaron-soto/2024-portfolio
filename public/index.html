        building new projects and learning the latest advancements to enhance my skills.

      <div id="extended-about" class="hidden">
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Casa Grande, Arizona. After graduating high school, I joined the military and became
          an Army Ranger, serving as a sergeant in the 75th Ranger Regiment. This role allowed me to travel the world,
          participate in the D-Day reenactment in Normandy, France, and earn my HALO (High Altitude Low Opening)
          military skydiving license, which led to my civilian skydiving license.</p>
        <p>
          Upon leaving the military, I worked in Arizona building RVs and Toy Haulers. While I enjoyed this job, I
          aspired to do something bigger. I began teaching myself programming and, once confident in my skills, enrolled
          in the Coding Dojo bootcamp to further my education in software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing the bootcamp, I quickly secured a position with a consulting company, working on various
          projects from simple Node.js servers to large-scale applications utilizing AWS and multiple repositories.
          During this time, I also started my own side business, AyeZeeWebDesigns, creating websites for local
          businesses.
        </p>
        <p>

          In my free time, I love building things, whether it's crafting wood furniture, using my 3D printer, or
          operating my CNC machine. I'm always working on something new. Additionally, I am constantly learning new
          technologies to incorporate into my projects.
